# Learning Vite

This is a repo that I created first time diving into Rollup.

[x] **Introduction.**

- There's a great [repo](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite) with Vite templates, plugins and other useful things.
- [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) for a quicker way of scaffolding templates than git clone.

[x] **Does Vite need loaders like webpack?**

No configuration for asset management is required. Just import stuff, and it will work as expected.

[x] **Integration with Babel.**

- [@rollup/plugin-babel](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/babel)

[ ] **Use Vite in a project**.
