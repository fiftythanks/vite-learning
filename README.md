# Learning Vite

This is a repo that I created first time diving into Rollup.

[x] **Introduction.**

- There's a great [repo](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite) with Vite templates, plugins and other useful things.
- [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) for a quicker way of scaffolding templates than git clone.

[ ] **Does Vite need loaders like webpack?**\
[ ] **Integration with Babel.**\
[ ] **Use Vite in a project**.
